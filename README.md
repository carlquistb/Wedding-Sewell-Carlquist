# Wedding-Sewell-Carlquist
Christi and Justin's wedding website.

This is a simple event website, written in React.js. Prominent features include a simple AWS DynamoDB table storage for DJ song requests, as well as (hopefully) a d3.js styled calendar of events and photos repository.

## Sections of the site
- Landing/introduction
- Day-of Schedule
- week schedule
- Song requests
- Photos repository
- Registry links and embedded info
- directions and nearby hotels
- Proposal history

## Design philosophy
This is a todo...

- how-to on d3.js.
- css barebones and libraries used.
